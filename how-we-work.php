                            GlucoCheck is a tracker that can give you an accurate feedback about how much, or how little, you are doing those things. 
                            By getting an accurate view of your blood sugar along with how much you're exercising, eating, and sleeping — you can make some real improvements.</p>

                        <p class="gc-text" style="text-align: right;">Research shows that tracking — and the awareness that comes with it — really works. Studies have found that people with diabetes who used apps — to record food, exercise, and other behavior -- had better long-term blood sugar control. </p>
