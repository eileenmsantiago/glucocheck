# Glucocheck
A data visualization tool to view and manage blood glucose levels â€” a diabetic's best friend.

# Introduction
My personal web development & web design project in the Interactive Media Management program. My goal for this project was to create something regarding to health, but is personal yet meaningful: a diabetes blood glucose (BG) tracking app. 

Having type 1 diabetes for 17 years, I've learned different ways in managing my BG levels, which is an every day challenge for myself. I thought it would be perfect to challenge and create something that could help me and other diabetics. You simply create an account to input and track your BG levels. The user is to enter their BG levels and depending on the level corresponds to a BG range (low - red, optimal - green, and high - yellow). The average blood glucose is available for the user to see as well as recording the highest and lowest value recorded in the user's dashboard. 

# App Functionality 
The project requirements included utilizing tools we've learned in the semester allowing us to learn the fundamentals and basics of web development. The breakdown of tools & languages I used to develop Glucochecks are:
1. HTML & CSS - page layout, structure, visual designs 
2. PHP - server-side and connecting to the database (cross-platform with MySQL)
3. MySQL - store and create queries in the database (cross-platform with PHP)
4. Vanilla JavaScript - ability to create interactivity in the site
